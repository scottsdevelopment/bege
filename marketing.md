How you present code is just as important as the code itself.

Most developers share snippets that are messy, unreadable, or hard to parse.

This creates friction for the reader and lowers the perceived quality of your engineering.

I built a micro-app called BEGE (Bad Example, Good Example) to fix this.

It is a specialized tool for creating "Bad vs Good" code comparisons with premium aesthetics.

• Built with React, Vite, and PrismJS.
• Features seamless gradient backgrounds (no white seams).
• Supports multi-language syntax highlighting.
• Exports high-res PNGs instantly.

The goal isn't just to make code pretty.

It is to make knowledge transfer efficient.
